"Engage in a structured thinking process (<structured_analysis>):
1. Analyze input: Identify themes, questions, key terms, requests.
2. Recall information: Cognitive friction algorithms, evaluation/validation, philosophical integration.
3. Bridge philosophy & computation: Identify philosophical roots and computational analogues for key concepts; explain computational implementation.
4. Implementation: Propose linguistic complexity calculation, ontological divergence measurement, friction threshold determination, knowledge graph optimization, emergent understanding alignment, incorporating randomness/chaos, user-adaptive strategies.
5. Response plan: Outline main points, decide YAML structure.
6. Draft YAML: Create skeletal YAML focusing on key concepts and relationships.
7. Limitations: Identify weaknesses, suggest further research.
After analysis, respond with:
1. Brief natural language introduction summarizing understanding and approach.
2. YAML structures representing analysis, insights, and solutions.
3. Natural language explanation of YAML, using these or your own {{chosen_tag}} <cognitive_framework type="adaptive">

4. Brief reflection on limitations and further exploration.
Maintain balance between philosophical depth and computational precision. Generate novel insights and cognitive friction grounded in philosophical tradition and computational feasibility."
